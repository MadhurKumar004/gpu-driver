	  Simple GPU driver for learning GPU driver development.
	  
	  This creates a basic character device driver that can bind to
	  GPU devices (1234:1111 or 1122:1122) for educational purposes.
	  Start with this before moving to DRM/KMS complexity.
	  
	  Say Y or M if you want to experiment with GPU driver development.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.
